# Emotion and Mental Health Chatbot

A mental health chatbot that uses Google's Gemini and Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis and mental health support. The app provides personalized responses to user queries and visualizes sentiment score in the form of pie charts to assess emotional states.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses Hugging Face's transformer models to analyze the sentiment of user input.
- **Mental Health Assistance**: Interacts with the user and provides emotional support based on predefined guidelines.
- **Emotion Visualization**: Visualizes sentiment analysis results (positive and negative emotions) as pie charts.
- **Crisis Detection**: Flags potential emotional crises based on sentiment score thresholds.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the web app.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: For generating responses based on the input provided by the user.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For sentiment analysis of user input.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating pie chart visualizations of sentiment.
- **Markdown**: For rendering Markdown responses in the chat.
